    <p> A great recipe for an electric breadmaker â€“ 
        or do it the traditional way.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
