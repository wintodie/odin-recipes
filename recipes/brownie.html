    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.
        </li>
